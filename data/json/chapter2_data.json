No, John said, there was little doubt in his mind that it was true. And then, by way of explanation, he launched into this parable."], [3, "JOHN B. McLEMORE", "Let me tell you something I saw one time."], [4, "BRIAN REED", "I should admit that at the time, this story was completely lost on me."], [5, "JOHN B. McLEMORE", "Me and Roger Price had went up to the truck stop together to get a little dinner. We came back by, and was passing by the South Forty trailer park. So Roger's one of these dudes, he's a darn transmission mechanic. He's not really talkative. He's a good dude, but he just\u2014you know, he only has one tooth. And it's really amusing to see how he can balance a cigarette on that one tooth. And the whole time he's talking\u2014 [LAUGHTER] \u2014this cigarette is just bouncing around all over that one tooth, and he never loses that son of a bitch. So we're coming by this \"Welcome to South Forty\" sign, and there's this girl out there walking around in front of the damn sign holding a cell phone, and she's got on a pink top and nothing else\u2014no fucking panties, no goddamn socks, barefoot. And I remark that to Roger. I don't remember what I said. I probably said, \"my God, look at her,\" or something like that. And Roger's sage advice was, usually when you see jokers that look like that, they done something to get like that."], [6, "BRIAN REED", "That's the lesson?"], [7, "JOHN B.

But I think I finally get it now. From Serial and This American Life, I'm Brian Reed. This is Shittown. My second night in Alabama, I finally get to talk to Jake Goodson. Jake's the guy who'd originally told John that Kabrahm Burt had bragged to him outside the Little Caesars about beating a guy to death. I sit with Jake in John's kitchen, asking him to rack his brain for any extra details that could help me solve this. It was a while ago, he says. His memories are fuzzy.

I don't give a fuck."], [27, "BRIAN REED", "Apparently I'm the puss, because I do not want the dudes I'm talking to to call Kabrahm right now. Already, this tattoo shop does not feel like the safest place to walk into alone at night, trying to dig up info about a covered-up murder by a guy everyone seems to know, all of which are things I've just done. The last thing I want right now is for the alleged murderer to show up. I was invited here by Tyler Goodson, Jake's brother, whom I met in John's workshop while he was filing that chainsaw. He's one of the owners. Tyler knows Kabrahm. They're both in their early 20s, and I thought maybe some of Tyler's friends who hang out here might have more information about the possible murder. John didn't feel like coming with me because he doesn't like driving at night. When I walk in, at first it seems like a pretty small place, just a couple of tattooing stations and a little waiting area. But if you push the back wall of the shop, it swings open. It's a secret door, which leads into a hidden clubhouse in the back. There's a bar with some people around it, a pool table, a small stage with motorcycles parked there, and a brass stripper pole that's currently vacant. The shop is called Black Sheep Ink, and I'll learn that the guys who hang out here take the name to heart. They see themselves as a collection of misfits, of self-proclaimed criminals and runaways and hillbillies. And Tyler has built this place as a haven for them, a place to swap their tales of getting jerked around by cops and judges and clerks and bosses, and to cultivate a sense of pride in their status as the outcasts of their world. There's this gentleman, whose name I never do catch, who tells me, quote, \"I'm so fucking fat, I don't care no more,\" and lifts up his shirt to show me the giant words he has tattooed on his stomach\u2014\"Feed Me.\""], [28, "MAN 4", "Tell him.

Three times, dude, one night.

One day, Tyler will tell me that he often wakes up in the morning in a puddle of sweat, having dreamt during the night of killing his dad. Tyler's friendly to me when I arrive, welcoming, but as I'm getting out my recording equipment, I hear murmurs from other people wondering who I am, wondering if I might be a cop. People are asking me questions, feeling me out. A few guys ask if I'll smoke a bowl with them out of some deer antlers. I don't want to be stoned, but I also don't want to seem like a narc, so I pretend to take a puff. I pretend to do a number of things that make me feel very uncomfortable in order to keep as low a profile as possible, such as act like I'm not shocked or upset or scared when someone says this to me, a radio producer with a microphone, in the first few minutes that we're talking.

And so you never\u2014I just want to ask you this again\u2014you never maybe were drunk one time and saying, yeah, I beat that guy to death to anyone? Because I heard that you were bragging about it from multiple people."], [127, "KABRAHM BURT", "Number one, that wouldn't even be something to brag about. It ain't like a deer or something, you know?"], [128, "BRIAN REED", "I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad to hear you say that, I got to say. So where would people get that from?"], [129, "KABRAHM BURT", "Just a damn small town, man. Shit gets fucking twisted."], [130, "BRIAN REED", "But saying that you told them directly to their face?"], [131, "KABRAHM BURT", "Hell, I don't know, buddy."], [132, "BRIAN REED", "I don't know either. I can't tell if what Kabrahm is saying to my face right now is true or not. I spoke to Kabrahm's father, too, Kendall Burt, and told him that John said he'd overheard him on the phone here at K3 one day saying something about how his son was guilty as hell, and he knew it. And Kendall told me he doesn't know what John heard him say, or if he heard him say anything, but that he's a tough-love kind of guy, and that if his son had done something like killed a person, he would never cover that up. According to Kabrahm, there is a moral to this story. He shares it with me after I wonder aloud to him about something one of the police officers told me. Why did his buddy Tim, rather than pressing charges against the man that almost killed him with a knife, decide instead to shove his middle finger in the face of the cops when they came to talk to him in his hospital bed?"], [133, "KABRAHM BURT", "I mean, nobody wants to be a tattletale."], [134, "BRIAN REED", "I mean, dude almost died. He got stabbed in the neck. Kabrahm takes a drag of his cigarette. You're shrugging your shoulders."], [135, "KABRAHM BURT", "If he gonna live like white trash and shit, then hell, you might as well not tell on nobody, because, you know, if that's the life you're trying to live, you can't be mad when, you know\u2014low-down, dirty shit like that happens when you hang out with low-down, dirty people."], [136, "BRIAN REED", "You there?"], [137, "JOHN B.

McLEMORE", "A bunch of fussing and fighting, snaggletooth, stolen trucks, meth labs, stabbing, hooping, hollering, and going to jail? I can't believe how much you've worked on this son of a bitch, and at the same time\u2014 [SIGH] My God."], [145, "BRIAN REED", "What? Why the sigh?"], [146, "JOHN B. McLEMORE", "I'm sitting here looking out the window at the clouds going by, just in loathing disgust at the town that I live in and the fact that I didn't pack my bags and get the hell out of here decades ago. I think it's the part about hiding in the woods that did it. That's just so classic Bibb County. I don't know how many times I've heard that expression in my life\u2014\"hiding in the woods.\" I think hiding in the woods in Bibb County is like having your afternoon tea in London."], [147, "BRIAN REED", "You know, there is another way John could have responded to all this news. I dare call it the normal way. That sigh he let out, rather than being one of despair, could have been one of relief\u2014relief that a young man has not been killed, that local officials have not been bought off by a powerful, rich family, and that, in fact, law enforcement has done what appears to be a competent job responding to this incident. Shittown, at least in this case, doesn't look so, so terrible to me. I don't know. Progress, right? [LAUGHTER] But no. I've learned that sometimes you catch John in a spell of depression, sometimes you catch him in a bout of mania, and sometimes, like today, I think, you catch him in an alchemy of the two.

McLEMORE", "Not by a long shot."], [159, "BRIAN REED", "Climate change is not ending. I am not bringing jobs and sustainable employment to Alabama and lifting people out of poverty.

McLEMORE", "I think you've done pretty goddamn good."], [161, "BRIAN REED", "Well, thank you."], [162, "BRIAN REED", "When John says he's been mulling over climate change for the past 10 hours, what I think he means is that he's been mulling over climate change for the past 10 hours. I don't think he's exaggerating. It's like work for him, like he's made it his job. We've now been talking to each other for a year and a half, and while some of that time we've discussed the murder, there's been so much other stuff John wants to chat about. It's interesting stuff, but it's all over the place. Even if I haven't talked to him in a while, nearly every day he sends me emails about all sorts of global calamities that he continues to keep up with, even though they've fallen out of the news."], [163, "JOHN B. McLEMORE", "How many people are still concerned today about the Philippines?"], [164, "BRIAN REED", "He's referring to Typhoon Haiyan from 2013. Or how about the tsunami in Sri Lanka in 2004, John says, or the terrible flood in Pakistan the year before last?"], [165, "JOHN B. McLEMORE", "Not hearing a lot about that, are you?"], [166, "BRIAN REED", "How about the fallout from the Ebola outbreak, or the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, or\u2014a deeper cut\u2014Chernobyl?

But the connection is deeper than that. He's distressed by the lack of outrage compared to the amount of shittiness in the world. To him, that ratio is totally out of whack. That's why he was still upset about the Kabrahm rumor, even after I told him it wasn't true. Even though the murder and the cover-up weren't real, everyone sure did believe they were, and still they did nothing. That part, the inaction\u2014that's more disturbing to John than the idea of the murder itself."], [177, "JOHN B. McLEMORE", "You know, I really hate that these kids know all the things that they know, and they just accept them as normal."], [178, "BRIAN REED", "I know.

McLEMORE", "Accept it as something you can't do nothing about."], [180, "BRIAN REED", "The shitty misfortunes John fixates on, they're not a bunch of disparate things. They're all the same thing. His Shittown is part of Bibb County, which is part of Alabama, which is part of the United States, which is part of Earth, which is experiencing climate change, which no one is doing anything about. It maddens John. The whole world is giving a collective shrug of its shoulders and saying fuck it. What I admire about John is that in his own misanthropic way, he's crusading against one of the most powerful, insidious forces we face\u2014resignation, the numb acceptance that we can't change things. He's trying to shake people out of their stupor, trying to convince them that it is possible to make their world a better place. Yes, that lady over there, she's barefoot and she's pantsless, but we can lend her shoes. We can give her some pants. Instead of just putting our heads down and speeding past her and muttering that she must have done something to get like that, we can ask her if she's in trouble, and we can offer her help. There is a different way. That's why John rants and raves at the tattoo parlor. That's why John adopts dozens of stray dogs. That's why he devotes night after night to studying and writing about climate change. That's why he contacted a national radio show and asked me to come investigate. And that's why I now see John is devoting so much energy to what is arguably his most ambitious project of all\u2014radically altering the life of Tyler Goodson."], [181, "JOHN B.

I bet you haven't dared."], [182, "BRIAN REED", "As the months have gone by since my trip to Alabama, I've heard more and more about Tyler. I've learned all about his tough childhood, the petty legal troubles that continue to dog him, his persistent financial problems, his struggle to support his three daughters, whom he had by the age of 21, and whom he loves dearly. John has devoted his life to restoring old clocks. Methodically and thoroughly, he sorts through the busted parts of these timepieces, trying to revive a sense of beauty and order. And in a way, that's what he's attempting to do with Tyler. Every time John picks up the phone and I ask what he's up to, Tyler's either there or he was just there, or he's waiting for him to get there. It seems like he's giving him consistent work. John's also been accompanying Tyler to court and hiring him a lawyer to help him clear up some misdemeanor charges and get his driver's license back. And Tyler's recently moved to the trailer park across the street from John, so now he can easily walk to John's place. John's even talking about writing Tyler and his brother Jake into his will."], [183, "JOHN B.

McLEMORE", "That's assuming the goddamn cops don't come in and steal it."], [186, "BRIAN REED", "But John's relationship with Tyler is not just as a benefactor. I can tell that they get something more from one another. John will mention a walk he and Tyler took through the woods, or an expedition they made to the junkyard to search for treasures, or he'll recount some bit of their conversation. They like to spend time together. One day, John was on the phone with me, and he looked out his window and started listing off the flowers that were in bloom in his yard, and the ones that were dying.

That's a sundial motto\u2014tedious and brief."], [188, "BRIAN REED", "Before we had clocks, we had sundials, and I never thought about this until I started talking to John, but watching a sundial, which could be as simple as a stick in the ground, as the shadow crept along, you were actually witnessing the rotation of the Earth. It's so much less abstracted than a clock, a level closer to time itself. Anyway, John told me sundials often have mottos engraved on them. John says \"tedious and brief\" is one. What do you mean, \"tedious and brief?\""], [189, "JOHN B. McLEMORE", "Your life is tedious and brief. All sundial mottos are sad like that."], [190, "BRIAN REED", "There are hundreds of these mottos. \"Life passes like this shadow.\" \"Make haste, but slowly.\" \"Use the hours, don't count them.\" \"Even as you watch, I'm fleeing.\" \"Soon comes night.\" These little reminders are out there, hidden in crannies around the world. I recently happened upon a sundial in the cemetery of an old Catholic mission next to a grave. Because of John, I knew to look for the motto. It read, \"Nil boni hodie. Diem perdidi.\" \"I did nothing good today. I have lost a day.\""], [191, "JOHN B. McLEMORE", "You know, I told you, I used to make sundials, but I made them for the mathematical exercise. You know, I would pick difficult dials to do as a test of my abilities of geometry and trigonometry. And these are things I wish Tyler and Jake could experience.

They've been constructing an adult swingset, a giant rectangular frame, to the side of John's house, not far from the apple trees, with a single John Deere tractor seat hanging from it. It has a 20-foot arc of action, John says, which I understand to mean it's a pretty gnarly swing. When John first told me about it, he'd said he was building it for himself. But now he amends that."], [193, "JOHN B. McLEMORE", "I think I built a swing for Tyler, actually. I found out that an old man of 50, when he swings in a swing for about 20 minutes, his back hurts and his knees hurt, so I didn't build it for me after all. I done found that out. So I think I built it for Tyler. Fuck it. Oh, and I built him a pull-up bar, because he wants to be strong. I told him, well, it's nice to be physically strong, but you need to be strong between the ears, because physical strength goes away. You know, you need to have strong neurons. And I told him, you need to have a little bit of general algebra. You should always have some trigonometry and you should have some geometry."], [194, "BRIAN REED", "What did he say?"], [195, "JOHN B. McLEMORE", "He never\u2014I remember this conversation. He said he never saw how it is that had anything you could do much with."], [196, "BRIAN REED", "I like imagining this odd pair, a polymathic, middle-aged clock restorer and a tatted-up kid in his 20s with a Harley and a revolver in his briefcase, out in John's yard on a summer's day, staking swingset poles into the ground, the dogs circling around them, maybe a butterfly fluttering by. I like imagining John interrupting their work for a minute to give Tyler a math lesson, feeling gratified that he has someone to give a math lesson to, and Tyler perhaps taking something from it, but at the very least humoring John, because he's grateful that John's helping him get his life together. I like knowing that this is how two people have chosen to spend an afternoon together in Bibb County, Alabama. \"Take the gifts of this hour,\" one sundial says.
